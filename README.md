# angular-spring-mongo
The front-end is built on Angular  localhost:4200
The back-end is run based on Spring localhost:8080
The database is connected to MongoDB localhost:27017

All the componentes are run on thier own localhost.
In order to run the database, it is important to create a local database named "spring"  and create a collection named "Intentory" under the spring database. 
In spring  run "YanliuFullstackTestApplication.java" as application, and the default database will add to the "Intentory" collection which u created before.
Then run the Angular and type localhost:4200 or localhost:4200/intentory in brower.U will see the completed application.
Thanks.
